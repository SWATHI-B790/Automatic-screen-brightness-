                <h1>Welcome to the Automatic Screen Brightness App</h1>
                <p>The Automatic Screen Brightness app adjusts the brightness of your device screen based on your environment's lighting conditions, providing optimal viewing comfort while reducing eye strain.</p>
                <p>With this app, your device will intelligently adapt its screen brightness to match ambient lighting, ensuring you have a comfortable viewing experience, whether in a dark room or under bright sunlight.</p>
                <p><strong>Protect Your Eyes:</strong> Constant exposure to bright screens in low-light conditions can cause eye strain and discomfort. This app helps reduce this by lowering the screen brightness in dark environments, preventing eye fatigue and improving comfort.</p>

                <h2>About Automatic Screen Brightness</h2>
                <p>Automatic Screen Brightness is a technology that adjusts the screen brightness of your device based on the surrounding light. This reduces power consumption and provides a better viewing experience by ensuring the screen is neither too bright nor too dim for the lighting conditions.</p>
                <p>The system uses sensors, usually located near the camera or on the front of the device, to measure the ambient light levels. It then adjusts the screen brightness in real-time, optimizing visibility while also saving battery life, especially when you're in low-light conditions.</p>
